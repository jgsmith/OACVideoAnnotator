title: How Video Annotator Works
---
Video Annotator is a developer's toolkit consisting of a number of [MITHgrid](/mithgrid/) components that you can use to add
annotation capabilities to videos embedded in your web site. See [the demo](/OACVideoAnnotator/demo.html) for an example of
the toolkit providing a simple annotation capability with an HTML 5 video tag.

The toolkit consists of three major parts: 

* the **core annotation manager** and associated RaphaÃ«l.js-based presentation that is placed over the video play surface,
* the **annotation content presentation** that can tie into the core annotation manager's data store, and
* the **video player driver**.

Additional components provide a way to create a set of mode buttons similar to a palette in a graphics editing program.
